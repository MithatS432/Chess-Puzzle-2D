# Chess-Puzzle-2D
Just like in chess, complete the matches and advance to the next level


# Game Explanation
A match-puzzle style game, similar to chess.

Matches are only possible with pawns, and special pieces cannot match each other. The task system allows for an endless loop with 20 moves or more.

We destroy objects using the same moves as in chess.

Matches;

1-)A chess rook formation with 4 horizontal and 4 vertical pieces.

2-)The formation of a square and a chess knight.

3-)Bishop formation using the T-shape algorithm.

4-)Queen formation also with the L-shaped algorithm.

5-)A king formation with 5 horizontal and vertical cards.
